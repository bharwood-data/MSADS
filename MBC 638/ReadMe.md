# MBC 658 - Data Analysis and Decision Making

Ben Harwood

## Contents

This project was completed in tandem with the project for IST 659. I looked at six months of sales data from the car dealership I work for to see if I could determine what factors contribute to how long a car sits on the lot before selling. The goal was to use Siz Sigma processes to develop a new strategy for ordering vehicles. Included are the data set and presentation. Note, the presentation is interactive, so be sure to actually run the slide show. A couple of the plots are tied to the data file, so you may need to open the data file first to speed up the loading of the presentation.

## Required Tools

Just PowerPoint
