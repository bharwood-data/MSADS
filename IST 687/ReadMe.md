# IST 687 - Applied Data Science

Ben Harwood

## Contents

This was my final project for IST 687. It was completed with Richard Bump, Xanier Noel, and Kevin Schaeffer. We looked at baseball statistics to see what justification could be found in favor of the National League adopting the designated hitter. Included are the data sets, R markdown file, the write-up produced by the R code, and the presentation deck.

## Required Tools

Just R.
