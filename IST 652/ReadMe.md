## Folder Description

This is ISt 652 final project. I wanted to see if governor speeches could impact how their states vote in presidential elections. The Python file and write-up are included. The Speeches folder contains each governor speech used in the study, and there is a csv file in this main folder with demographic data from the 2016 election.

## Tools needed
Just Python, but nltk and wordcloud packages are required.
