## Contents

This is the final project for IST 736. We used tweets from various political figures to train a machine learning algorithm to detect the political affiliation. We then applied that model to various hashtags popular during the recent election to assign parties to the invidiual writing the tweet. The goal was to see if we could predict when a tweet is supposed to reflect one ideology but actually reflected the other.
