# IST 707 - Data Analytics

## Contents

This folder contains the project I submitted, along with Kevin Vogel, Nina Williams, and Kyle Wass for IST 707. This was the first truly in-depth project that I had in the program. We looked at census data to see if we could predict where the United Way places its locations using several different techniques. Included are the data sets, R code file, write-up, and presentation deck.

## Required Tools
