# IST 664: Natural Language Processing

Ben Harwood

## Contents

This folder contains my final project for IST 664. This project was done with Kevin Vogel. In it, we looked at gubernatorial inaugural addresses for consecutive, opposite party governors from 10 states (i.e. democrat followed by a republican, and vice-versa) to see what features of the language used could predict the party affiliation. 

Included are the Python program, all of the speeches in their raw form, two csv's with the speeches tokenized into sentences with the sentences labelled with the appropriate party, and the write-up of the results.

## Tools Required

Python, with nltk
